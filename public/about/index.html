        <!--
I graduated from [BGSU](https://www.bgsu.edu/) in 2018 with a non comp-sci degree and quickly discovered I wanted something more challenging.

My friend had gone through [Tech Elevator](https://www.techelevator.com/) and it was the perfect match. I enrolled in the 3 month course and graduated late 2020 when everyone was hiring remote. My first professional software developer role was at [JPMC](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) which was not actually that much programming...

This led me to learn ruby entirely on my own via [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and gain a deep understanding of ruby and of course my next more challenging role.

My time at [Weedmaps](https://weedmaps.com/) really kick started my career due to the amazingly talented engineers I got to spend my days with. However this was cut short due to the tech-bubble popping in 2022 and I was unfortunately one of the thousands of engineers who got laid off that year. The timing was terrible. My now wife and I were going through the *execellent* and *fun* process with the USCIS getting her K1 visa. I needed proof of employment for her to get into the country. I was literally at the bank getting documentation of my finances when I could not access the company slack. Of course the previous day I had reached out to HR to get a letter of employment which they provided. But due to me getting laid off and losing access to the company slack that had disappeared.

I needed a job quick.

My friend who used to play [OSRS](https://oldschool.runescape.com/) with me saw the news that WM had done some lay offs and they reached out and got that juicy employee referal bonus we all crave.

My application and employment was fast-passed at Enova my current role.

<p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/">BGSU</a> in 2018 with a non-computer science degree, but it didn&rsquo;t take long to realize I wanted something more challenging.</p>
<p>A friend introduced me to <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a>, and it turned out to be the perfect fit. I completed their 3-month bootcamp and graduated in late 2020, right when remote roles were booming. My first professional developer job was at <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/">JPMC</a>, though, truthfully, it wasn’t as coding-heavy as I hoped.</p>
<p>Hungry for more hands-on experience, I taught myself Ruby through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. This gave me a deep understanding of the language and paved the way for my next role—a step up in both challenge and learning opportunity.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://weedmaps.com/">Weedmaps</a>, my career truly took off. I was surrounded by talented engineers who pushed me to grow daily. Unfortunately, like many others in 2022, I was caught in the tech-bubble layoffs. The timing couldn&rsquo;t have been worse: my now-wife and I were in the middle of the USCIS K1 visa collecting financial records. I even learned I was laid off while at the bank. To make things trickier, I lost access to company Slack, where the employment verification letter I needed was downloadable, but no longer.</p>
<p>I needed a job—fast.</p>
<p>Luckily, a friend I used to play <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.com/">OSRS</a> with noticed the Weedmaps layoff news and reached out. They referred me to <a href="https://www.enova.com/">Enova</a> (and likely enjoyed that sweet referral bonus). My application and onboarding were fast-tracked, and now I&rsquo;m thriving in my current role.</p>
