I graduated from [BGSU](https://www.bgsu.edu/) in 2018 with a non-computer science degree, but it didn't take long to realize I wanted something more challenging.

A friend introduced me to [Tech Elevator](https://www.techelevator.com/), and it turned out to be the perfect fit. I completed their 3-month bootcamp and graduated in late 2020, right when remote roles were booming. My first professional developer job was at [JPMC](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), though, truthfully, it wasn’t as coding-heavy as I hoped.

Hungry for more hands-on experience, I taught myself Ruby through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This gave me a deep understanding of the language and paved the way for my next role—a step up in both challenge and learning opportunity.

At [Weedmaps](https://weedmaps.com/), my career truly took off. I was surrounded by talented engineers who pushed me to grow daily. Unfortunately, like many others in 2022, I was caught in the tech-bubble layoffs. The timing couldn't have been worse: my now-wife and I were in the middle of the USCIS K1 visa collecting financial records. I even learned I was laid off while at the bank. To make things trickier, I lost access to company Slack, where the employment verification letter I needed was downloadable, but no longer.

I needed a job—fast.

Luckily, a friend I used to play [OSRS](https://oldschool.runescape.com/) with noticed the Weedmaps layoff news and reached out. They referred me to [Enova](https://www.enova.com/) (and likely enjoyed that sweet referral bonus). My application and onboarding were fast-tracked, and now I'm thriving in my current role.
